            Playboi Carti always delivers on spectacle, mosh pit-ready tracks, and quotable lyrics (who can forget “jumpoutthehouse” being repeated 5000 times?). However, he is notorious for being one of the most untrustworthy rappers with release dates. 
            Take his last studio album, Whole Lotta Red, which had a rollout that felt like a whole lotta cap. In a June 2019 cover story for The FADER, he revealed that some of the album’s features included Trippie Redd and Gunna. Then, a month later, he announced during a show that there wouldn’t be any features on the album, but it would be out in the next 60 days—more cap.
