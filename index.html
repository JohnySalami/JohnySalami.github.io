            Playboi Carti always delivers on spectacle, mosh pit-ready tracks, and quotable lyrics (who can forget “jumpoutthehouse” being repeated 5000 times?). However, he is notorious for being one of the most untrustworthy rappers with release dates. 
            Take his last studio album, Whole Lotta Red, which had a rollout that felt like a whole lotta cap. In a June 2019 cover story for The FADER, he revealed that some of the album’s features included Trippie Redd and Gunna. Then, a month later, he announced during a show that there wouldn’t be any features on the album, but it would be out in the next 60 days—more cap.

        <div class="half-width-column">
            At the beginning of 2020, Carti said that the album would be coming that year, and surprisingly, it was delivered with only a couple of days of the 365 to spare. Wasting no time, he shared that a new project was on the horizon.
            It’s been almost four years since Carti said I AM MUSIC is “coming soon.” The only thing certain about a Carti rollout is snippets and leaks followed by a trail of alleged “album dropping soon” headlines.
            Rather than scouring forums and fan pages, we’ve compiled everything we know about I Am Music that is (hopefully) of importance.

            In an April 2022 interview with XXL, Carti started sharing details about the project after giving a brief teaser two years prior. He shared that the title was simply Music “because that’s where I’m at, you know what I’m saying? Music.”
            When it comes to what Music would be covering, Carti said that he is talking about all things “Love. Sex. Drugs. Changes in my life. I’ve been rapping about going to rehab. I want to go to rehab because I think I’m bipolar. I want everybody to feel free. I want this album to make everyone feel free. I hope this album brings peace to the world, honestly. I’m in love with what I’m doing. Like I told you, you can’t put a genre alternative [on me]. My little brother told me that all the time.”
