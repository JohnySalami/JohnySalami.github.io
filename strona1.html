                    Playboi Carti always delivers on spectacle, mosh pit-ready tracks, and quotable lyrics (who can forget “jumpoutthehouse” being repeated 5000 times?). However, he is notorious for being one of the most untrustworthy rappers with release dates. 
                    Take his last studio album, Whole Lotta Red, which had a rollout that felt like a whole lotta cap. In a June 2019 cover story for The FADER, he revealed that some of the album’s features included Trippie Redd and Gunna. Then, a month later, he announced during a show that there wouldn’t be any features on the album, but it would be out in the next 60 days—more cap.

                    More people in Carti’s camp began talking about the project, with producer F1LTHY (known for producing tracks like “Sky” and “Stop Breathing”) giving his take on what’s holding the project up.

                    Addressing the leaks, F1LTHY said during an April 2023 livestream that leakers are “ruining everything, just so y’all know…That’s why n***** ain’t recording. We ain’t gon’ do nothing. Fuck y’all n*****.” F1LTHY goes on to imply that the leaks were responsible for a shelved album. “N***** had an album for y’all. It wasn’t make-believe.”

                    Over a year after the XXL interview, Carti gave fans another update in a November interview with Numéro Berlin. He named three different cities he had been recording in and how the atmosphere of each shaped the music.

                    “I’ve been recording in Paris, I love Paris. Amazing. I was recording in a cave for like three months, and all the music that came out of that is just chaotic and crazy.”
    
                    That quote alone went viral, with fans immediately imagining Carti hanging upside down in full vampire mode, creating his next greatest hit. However, his recording studio actually had a modern and comfy look.

                    At the beginning of 2020, Carti said that the album would be coming that year, and surprisingly, it was delivered with only a couple of days of the 365 to spare. Wasting no time, he shared that a new project was on the horizon.
                    It’s been almost four years since Carti said I AM MUSIC is “coming soon.” The only thing certain about a Carti rollout is snippets and leaks followed by a trail of alleged “album dropping soon” headlines.
                    Rather than scouring forums and fan pages, we’ve compiled everything we know about I Am Music that is (hopefully) of importance.

                    In an April 2022 interview with XXL, Carti started sharing details about the project after giving a brief teaser two years prior. He shared that the title was simply Music “because that’s where I’m at, you know what I’m saying? Music.”
                    When it comes to what Music would be covering, Carti said that he is talking about all things “Love. Sex. Drugs. Changes in my life. I’ve been rapping about going to rehab. I want to go to rehab because I think I’m bipolar. I want everybody to feel free. I want this album to make everyone feel free. I hope this album brings peace to the world, honestly. I’m in love with what I’m doing. Like I told you, you can’t put a genre alternative [on me]. My little brother told me that all the time.”

                    It took over a year before his ride-or-die fanbase could get any genuine news about the album until DJ Swamp Izzo stepped up to the mic. The Atlanta DJ has been working closely with Carti and spoke about the new project in an interview with Voices in the Street Unfiltered. 
                    “Playboi Carti album is done. I’ma give that to a world premiere. Swamp Izzo and Playboi Carti’s album is done. One more time, Swamp Izzo and Playboi Carti’s album is done,” he officially announced at the beginning of 2023. 
                    Understandably, fans were doubtful of DJ Swamp Izzo’s excited proclamation. “I don’t believe anyone when they say an album is done cause they can change the whole thing the next day especially carti,” X user Karma said in February 2023.
